# CompetitiveCatabolism
This repository accompanies the paper "Competitive catabolism in systemic mammalian metabolic homeostasis" and contains the code and models used in the study, including the mechanistic multi‑nutrient model and the detailed mitochondrial model, together with simulation functions, Jupyter notebooks, and analysis scripts to reproduce figures and experiments.

## Folder Structure

- `multi_nutrient_model/` — Mechanistic multi-nutrient metabolic model and analyses for insulin action, nutrient competition, and metabolic phenotypes. Includes simulation functions and Jupyter notebooks for reproducing study figures and experiments.
- `detailed_model/` — Detailed kinetic and thermodynamic modeling of mitochondrial metabolism and fuel competition. Contains model construction, parameter sampling, fuel competition, and robustness analysis notebooks and scripts.
- `web_app/` — Web application code (under construction).
- Other files and folders — Data, outputs, logs, and configuration files for running and analyzing models.

Each main folder contains its own README with detailed instructions for installation, usage, and reproducing results. Please refer to those READMEs for step-by-step guidance.
